        <h1 class="textCentered"> Why is the web desgin bad </h1>
        <br>
        <p class="textCentered"> <b> Honest Reason </b>  Despite me (FailedWare37) going to a Web Development class I learned barely a thing from it due to the lack of information my teacher would give me, thus I dont know jack shit about CSS or HTML </p>
        <p class="textCentered"> <b> Dishonest Reason </b> it isnt about the desgin its about the memes </p>
